"""salmonconclude module.

This module calculates the final email rating using the functions in this module
and the Spam class from the salmonspam module. First, it creates instance of 
the Spam class from thr email fields that are prepared as a dictionary from the salmonmailparser module. 
Then it creates an instance of the MailFields class that represents a
table with email fields in the database, instance of the Sender class that represents
a table with the sender informations and list of instances of the Recipient class 
that represents a table with the recipient informations. Using Spam class methods,
the final email rating is calculated and passed to the salmonrelay module.
